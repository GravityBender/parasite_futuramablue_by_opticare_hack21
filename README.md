Hackathon 2021: Futurama Blue by Opticare
Project name: 	Futurama Blue(lens of the future) by OptiCare.
Tagline: Futurama Blue is a blue light filter spectacle which has built-in earphone, mic, and a mini-camera near one of the lens. 

The problem it solves: 
We came up with the idea through our daily routine. The lockdown imposed during the CoVID-19 pandemic has forced us to work from home, thus making us spend most of our time working in front of laptops/computers, mobiles. This has resulted in extreme strain on our eyes. The harmful radiation from these screens strains the eyes and could further lead to poor vision. 

To solve this issue, we are introducing the futuristic glasses “Futurama Blue” which will have blue light filter lenses, microphone below one of the endpieces, earphones near the ears(with detachable earplugs), a camera near the lens so that the wearer can take a photo whenever they want and through the angle they are seeing the view reducing the time taken to take out their phone or taking a screenshot on the laptop as they can clearly take a picture of the screen. The frame of the eyeglasses would be made from light-weight plastic which would also be durable(we would also provide the buyer the option to choose other frame materials). The filter lenses would be scratch-proof providing excellent resistance from scratches, protection against daily abuse, plus toughness for long wearing use. The earphones and the mic would remove the hassle of wearing a headphone while also protecting the eyes from irritation. The frame of the spectacle would be light-weight and wouldn’t feel heavy on the ears and nose.
